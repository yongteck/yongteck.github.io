# What is a portfolio?

A personal page or portfolio is a public document that you create to showcase your achievements, projects, and thoughts. This can be useful for:

- when you're meeting someone and want to give them a quick way to see your best or ongoing work,
- helping potential employeers or collaborators discover specific talents of people working on specific problems they are facing,
- building your audience: people who are interested in things you are working on, or things you say about a topic/topics.

A few examples (out of many):
- https://isaak.net/about/
  This personal page lists a few ways that Isaak stands out, his interests, recent awards, and supporters.

  My About page quickly briefs potential collaborators about my ongoing interests, influences, and ongoing projects.
